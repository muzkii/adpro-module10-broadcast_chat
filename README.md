## Module 10 - Asynchronous Programming - Broadcast Chat

### Original Code of Broadcast Chat

#### Server

#### Client

#### How to Run It

- Start the server :
```bash
cargo run --bin server
```

- Create 3 separate terminals, with each run the command"

```bash
cargo run --bin client
```

When we initially connect instances of the `client` to our server (when we do `cargo run --bin client`), we would actually see tht there is a new connection output on the `server` telling that there is a new connection from different port numbers. This is because each terminal acts as `clients` that runs within the same device, essentially making port numbers used as doors in a house. When we type some texts in the `client` terminal, each client connects using WebSocket and can send/receive messages. Messages typed into one client are broadcast to all others in real-time, as seen on the image of the `client` above, even though I only type the message "terminal X" on the respective terminal, it also appears on every terminal.

### Modifying the Websocket Port

We can change the port number both in `server.rs` and in `client.rs`. Changes on both of the file can be see on the before and after below respectively:

- Before `server.rs` :
```Rust
    ...
    let listener = TcpListener::bind("127.0.0.1:2000").await?;
    println!("listening on port 2000");
    ...
```

- After `server.rs` :
```Rust
    ...
    let listener = TcpListener::bind("127.0.0.1:8080").await?;
    println!("listening on port 8080");
    ...
```

- Before `client.rs`:
```Rust
    ...
    ClientBuilder::from_uri(Uri::from_static("ws://127.0.0.1:2000"))
    ...
```

- After `client.rs`:
```Rust
    ...
    ClientBuilder::from_uri(Uri::from_static("ws://127.0.0.1:8080"))
    ...
```

We have to make sure both sides use the same port, otherwise the client cannot connect. The port was changed to 8080 to test configurability. The protocol remains `ws://` â€” WebSocket over plain TCP. Imagine the server is like a phone operator waiting for calls. It doesn't specifically say 'I'm handling WebSocket calls,' but it's set up to listen on a particular phone line (port) for any incoming calls (TCP connections). Once a call comes in, it immediately hands that call over to a specialized 'WebSocket call center' (the `tokio-websocket crate`) that knows exactly how to speak the WebSocket 'language' and handle the conversation. So, while it doesn't announce it upfront, it's definitely doing WebSocket work behind the scenes.
